1)Reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning, in which agents take actions in an environment aimed at maximizing their cumulative rewards – NVIDIA
2)Reinforcement learning (RL) is based on rewarding desired behaviors or punishing undesired ones. Instead of one input producing one output, 
the algorithm produces a variety of outputs and is trained to select the right one based on certain variables – Gartner



The world of reinforcement learning (RL) offers a diverse toolbox of algorithms. Some popular examples include Q-learning, policy gradient methods, and 
Monte Carlo methods, along with temporal difference learning. Deep RL takes things a step further by incorporating powerful deep neural networks into the RL framework. 
One such deep RL algorithm is Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO).

However, despite their variety, all these algorithms can be neatly


Reinforcement Learning is a part of machine learning. Here, agents are self-trained on reward and punishment mechanisms. 
It’s about taking the best possible action or path to gain maximum rewards and minimum punishment through observations in a specific situation.
It acts as a signal to positive and negative behaviors. Essentially an agent (or several) is built that can perceive and interpret the environment in which is placed,
furthermore, it can take actions and interact with it.
For agentic AI, RL shines in partially observable MDPs (POMDPs), where agents must infer hidden states — mirroring real-world uncertainty.

## Q Why Reinforcement learning
https://arxivexplained.com/papers/the-landscape-of-agentic-reinforcement-learning-for-llms-a-survey
Old Way (Conventional LLM-RL): This is like a student taking a single-question exam. The LLM receives a prompt (the question), generates a single block of text (the answer), and gets a final score. It's a one-shot, static process. The paper calls this a "degenerate single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP)."
New Way (Agentic RL): This is like a detective solving a complex case. The agent must perform a sequence of actions over time (e.g., search the web, run code, analyze a file), operate with incomplete information, and adapt its strategy based on new evidence. In artificial intelligence Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are used to model situations where decisions are made one after another and the results of actions are uncertain.
The final reward might only come after a long chain of decisions. The paper formalizes this as a "partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)."



## Q what is Markov decision process ?
Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a way to describe how a decision-making agent like a robot or game character moves through different situations while trying to achieve a goal. 
It's components are
States: The different situations an agent can be in, containing all necessary information for decision-making. 
Actions: The choices an agent can make in a given state. 
Transition Probabilities: The likelihood that an action will lead from one state to another, incorporating the uncertainty of the environment. 
Rewards: A value received by the agent after performing an action in a state, which can be positive (reward) or negative (cost). 
Policy: The strategy or thought process the agent uses to select an action based on the current state. The goal is to find an optimal policy that maximizes long-term reward. 




Reward Function — "What You Want"

The reward function defines the immediate feedback from the environment.

It tells the agent how good or bad a single action was in a particular state.


R(s,a,s,)=reward after taking action a in state s leading to s
′

It’s designed by you, the human — it defines the goal of the agent.

Example (in your truck routing case):

reward = - fuel_cost + delivery_success_bonus - delay_penalty


So it’s the immediate “score” for one step.

🧮 2️⃣ Value Function — "What’s Expected Next"

The value function is what the agent learns during training.

It estimates the expected total future reward from a given state (or state-action pair).

📘 Formally:

State Value Function (V):

𝑉(𝑠)=𝐸[total future rewards starting from state 𝑠]

These are predictions — not defined by you, but learned through experience.
Action Value Function (Q):

Q(s,a)=E[total future rewards if we take action a in s]

These are predictions — not defined by you, but learned through experience.

Concept	Who defines it	Meaning	Example
Reward Function	You (the environment)	Instant feedback for one step	“+10 for on-time delivery, −2 for fuel used”
Value Function	Learned by model	Expected long-term reward from a state	“If I’m at warehouse A, expected total reward = +45”

## Algorithms 

Reinforcement learning (RL) tackles problems where an agent interacts with an environment, learning through trial and error to maximize rewards. Two main categories of models are used:
** ml free based(value based, policy based) and ml model based**

Traditional RL Models: Suitable for smaller environments and rely on simpler function approximation.
Deep Reinforcement Learning Models: Leverage deep learning techniques (like neural networks) for complex, high-dimensional environments.
Traditional RL Models
Markov Decision Process (MDP’s)
Markov Decision Process (MDP’s) are mathematical frameworks for mapping solutions in RL. The set of parameters that include Set of finite states – S, Set of possible Actions in each state – A, Reward – R, Model – T, Policy – π. The outcome of deploying an action to a state doesn’t depend on previous actions or states but on current action and state.

Markov Decision Process , Reinforcemnet learning
Q Learning
It’s a value-based model free approach for supplying information to intimate which action an agent should perform. It revolves around the notion of updating Q values which shows the value of doing action A in state S. Value update rule is the main aspect of the Q-learning algorithm.

Qlearning, reinforcement learning
SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
Similar to Q-Learning but focuses on learning the value of the specific action taken in the current state, considering the next state reached. This can be computationally more efficient than Q-Learning in some cases.

These models often use techniques like Monte Carlo methods to estimate the value of states or state-action pairs. Monte Carlo methods involve simulating multiple playthroughs of the environment to gather reward information and update the agent’s policy accordingly.

Deep Reinforcement Learning Models
Deep Q-Learning (DQL): Combines Q-Learning with a deep neural network to approximate the Q-value function. This allows DQL to handle complex environments with many states and actions, where traditional function approximation methods might struggle. DQL has been a major breakthrough in deep rl.
Policy Gradient Methods: These methods directly train the policy function, which maps states to actions. One approach is REINFORCE, which uses Monte Carlo methods to estimate the gradient of the expected reward with respect to the policy parameters. This gradient is then used to update the policy in a direction that increases the expected reward. More advanced methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) address limitations of REINFORCE to improve stability and performance.
Actor-Critic Methods: Combine an actor (policy network) and a critic (value network) for joint policy learning and value estimation. The actor learns the policy, while the critic evaluates the value of states or state-action pairs. This combined approach can improve learning efficiency and stability.

Conclusion
Reinforcement learning guides us in determining actions that maximize long-term rewards. However, it may struggle in partially observable or non-stationary environments. Moreover, its effectiveness diminishes when ample supervised learning data is available. A key challenge lies in managing parameters to optimize learning speed.

Hope now you got the feel and certain level of the description on Reinforcement Learning.



## PPO
Intuitive Explanation

PPO is a type of policy gradient algorithm, meaning:

The agent learns a policy (a mapping from states → actions).

It updates this policy using gradient ascent on how good the actions are (the reward).

PPO improves stability and avoids making large, destructive updates to the policy.

🔹 Key Ideas Behind PPO

Clipped Objective Function
  
  PPO limits how much the new policy can differ from the old one during an update.
  
  This prevents the agent from making too big a change in one training step.
  
  The “proximal” part means it keeps updates close (proximal) to the previous policy.

On-policy Algorithm
  
  PPO learns from the data generated by the current policy (not from past experiences like DQN).

Uses Advantage Function

It learns from how much better an action was compared to average (called “advantage”).

🔹 In Code (Stable-Baselines3)
from stable_baselines3 import PPO

model = PPO("MlpPolicy", "CartPole-v1", verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)

  
  "MlpPolicy" → uses a neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron) as the policy.
  
  "CartPole-v1" → OpenAI Gym environment.

The agent learns to balance the pole by trial and error.

We can create our own environment in gymnasium
The primary motivation for using Gym instead of just base Python or some other programming language is designed to interact with other RL Python modules. One such module is stablebaselines3, which allows you to quickly train RL models on these environments without having to write all the algorithms yourself.
