1)Reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning, in which agents take actions in an environment aimed at maximizing their cumulative rewards – NVIDIA
2)Reinforcement learning (RL) is based on rewarding desired behaviors or punishing undesired ones. Instead of one input producing one output, 
the algorithm produces a variety of outputs and is trained to select the right one based on certain variables – Gartner



The world of reinforcement learning (RL) offers a diverse toolbox of algorithms. Some popular examples include Q-learning, policy gradient methods, and 
Monte Carlo methods, along with temporal difference learning. Deep RL takes things a step further by incorporating powerful deep neural networks into the RL framework. 
One such deep RL algorithm is Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO).

However, despite their variety, all these algorithms can be neatly


Reinforcement Learning is a part of machine learning. Here, agents are self-trained on reward and punishment mechanisms. 
It’s about taking the best possible action or path to gain maximum rewards and minimum punishment through observations in a specific situation.
It acts as a signal to positive and negative behaviors. Essentially an agent (or several) is built that can perceive and interpret the environment in which is placed,
furthermore, it can take actions and interact with it.
