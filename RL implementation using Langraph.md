Define the RL Components within the LangGraph Structure:
1) State: The current state of the agent within the LangGraph, representing the information available to the agent at a given node.
This could include user queries, retrieved information, previous agent actions, and current context.
2) Actions: The choices an agent can make at a particular node, such as selecting a tool, routing to another agent, generating a response, or modifying the state.
3) Rewards: Feedback signals that evaluate the effectiveness of an agent's actions. Rewards can be explicit (e.g., human feedback on response quality) or implicit (e.g., successful task completion, reduced error rates).
Policy: The strategy an agent uses to select actions based on the current state. In LangGraph, this could be represented by the routing logic between nodes or the decision-making process within a node.
