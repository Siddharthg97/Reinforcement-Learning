Define the RL Components within the LangGraph Structure:
1) State: The current state of the agent within the LangGraph, representing the information available to the agent at a given node.
This could include user queries, retrieved information, previous agent actions, and current context.
2) Actions: The choices an agent can make at a particular node, such as selecting a tool, routing to another agent, generating a response, or modifying the state.
3) Rewards: Feedback signals that evaluate the effectiveness of an agent's actions. Rewards can be explicit (e.g., human feedback on response quality) or implicit (e.g., successful task completion, reduced error rates).
Policy: The strategy an agent uses to select actions based on the current state. In LangGraph, this could be represented by the routing logic between nodes or the decision-making process within a node.


You’ve now got a hybrid decision-making engine combining:

RL (optimization)

LLM (explanation/reasoning)

LangGraph (orchestration)

Component	Purpose
LangGraph	Orchestrates workflow between nodes
PPO Node	Makes optimal decision numerically
LLM Node	Explains and interprets RL action
Validator Node	Applies rule-based sanity checks
Logger Node	Outputs dispatch summary


🔄 Decision Cycle 1
📦 Dispatch Summary:
Truck: Truck_2
Route: Route_3
Reasoning: Assigning Truck_2 to Route_3 is efficient given moderate load and short distance.
Validation: ✅ Acceptable

🔄 Decision Cycle 2
📦 Dispatch Summary:
Truck: Truck_1
Route: Route_4
Reasoning: Truck_1 may struggle with Route_4 due to long distance.
Validation: ⚠️ Risky - long route for small truck
